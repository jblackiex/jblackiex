# 🎛️ DNAfx Pedal Mod - Turn Your Pedal into a Smart Looper & Tuner Controller 🎸

> 🚨 First real-world hardware hack from a software dev stepping into electronics.  
> 🧠 No professional background — just passion, curiosity, and lots of trial & error.

Welcome to my **DIY mod project** for the DNAfx GiT multi-effects pedal!  
This hack turns a standard guitar pedal into a **smart device** with:

✅ Looper track import UNLOCKED!  
✅ Remote control via server-side Raspberry Pi and client-side Android App!   
✅ USB HID + GPIO dual mode  
✅ Relay-triggered looper & tuner  
✅ Custom 3D-printed backplate  
✅ Live performance ready!

🎯 *Goal:* Expand a closed pedal system into an open, modular platform — all using Python, relays, a breadboard, and a lot of experimentation.
📦 Check out the [circuit diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/801ec904-747f-40c8-86a8-fbb14ffee57e/view?invitationId=inv_92bd5a81-6f77-4953-a02e-ab45b900d2ef&page=0_0#), build steps, and code in this repo --> [DNAfx_Hack](https://github.com/jblackiex/DNAfx_Hack)

🛠️ *Built entirely from scratch – my first ever hardware project!*
