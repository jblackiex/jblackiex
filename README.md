# 🎛️ DNAfx Pedal Mod - Turn Your Pedal into a Smart Looper & Tuner Controller 🎸🤖

> 🚨 First real-world hardware hack from a software dev stepping into electronics.  
> 🧠 No professional background — just passion, curiosity, and lots of trial & error.

Welcome to my **DIY mod project** for the DNAfx GiT multi-effects pedal!  
This hack turns a standard guitar pedal into a **programmable smart controller** with:

✅ Looper track import from mobile  
✅ Remote control via Raspberry Pi  
✅ USB HID + GPIO dual mode  
✅ Relay-triggered looper & tuner  
✅ Custom 3D-printed backplate  
✅ Live performance ready!

🎯 *Goal:* Expand a closed pedal system into an open, modular platform — all using Python, relays, a breadboard, and pure experimentation.

📦 Check out the [circuit diagram](https://github.com/jblackiex/DNAfx_Hack), build steps, and code in this repo!  
🛠️ *Built entirely from scratch – my first ever hardware project!*
